# J2534Diag Drivability Scanner

**J2534Diag** is an open source drivability scanner for Windows, designed to interface with a J2534 pass-thru device ("J2534 Box") and communicate with OBDII vehicles using Mode 1 and Mode 6. The application provides advanced diagnostics, including fuel trim mapping, misfire monitoring, and CAN network message analysis.
